Shared Dependencies:

1. "src/main.py": This is the main entry point of the program. It imports and uses functions from "animation.py", "bicycle.py", "wheel.py", "line.py", and "utils.py". It also uses the assets "bicycle_shape_1.png" and "bicycle_shape_2.png" and generates the output file "bicycle_simulation.mp4".

2. "src/animation.py": This file contains the main animation logic. It imports and uses functions from "bicycle.py", "wheel.py", "line.py", and "utils.py". It also uses the assets "bicycle_shape_1.png" and "bicycle_shape_2.png" and generates the output file "bicycle_simulation.mp4".

3. "src/bicycle.py": This file contains the Bicycle class, which uses the Wheel class from "wheel.py" and the Line class from "line.py". It also uses functions from "utils.py".

4. "src/wheel.py": This file contains the Wheel class, which uses functions from "utils.py".

5. "src/line.py": This file contains the Line class, which uses functions from "utils.py".

6. "src/utils.py": This file contains utility functions that are used by "main.py", "animation.py", "bicycle.py", "wheel.py", and "line.py".

7. "assets/bicycle_shape_1.png" and "assets/bicycle_shape_2.png": These are image files that are used by "main.py" and "animation.py" to represent the bicycle.

8. "output/bicycle_simulation.mp4": This is the output file that is generated by "main.py" and "animation.py".

Function Names:

1. "main": This is the main function in "main.py" that starts the program.

2. "animate": This is the main function in "animation.py" that runs the animation.

3. "Bicycle": This is the constructor of the Bicycle class in "bicycle.py".

4. "Wheel": This is the constructor of the Wheel class in "wheel.py".

5. "Line": This is the constructor of the Line class in "line.py".

6. "utils": This is a collection of utility functions in "utils.py".

Data Schemas:

1. "Bicycle": This is a class in "bicycle.py" that represents a bicycle. It has properties like "wheels" (an array of Wheel objects) and "line" (a Line object).

2. "Wheel": This is a class in "wheel.py" that represents a wheel. It has properties like "radius" and "position".

3. "Line": This is a class in "line.py" that represents a line. It has properties like "slope" and "intercept".

4. "Frame": This is a data structure that represents a frame in the animation. It contains a timestamp and a state of the bicycle (a Bicycle object).
